This repository contains two main folders: "Student Performance Analysis" and "Frailty Analysis."

Student Performance Analysis:

In the "Student Performance Analysis" folder, you'll find data related to student performance. This data includes various fields such as gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course, math scores, reading scores, and writing scores.

Within the "Student Performance Analysis" folder, there is a structured organization consisting of the following subfolders:

data_raw: This folder holds the original, unprocessed data files. data_clean: Here, you can find the data that has undergone preprocessing, making it suitable for analysis. src: This folder contains scripts written in Python for data preprocessing and analysis. results: In this directory, you'll find the outcomes and results generated from the data analysis. It's important to note that the Python programming language and software tools like Jupyter and Python itself are used to run the scripts for preprocessing and data visualization.

Frailty Analysis:

In the "Frailty Analysis" folder, you'll find data related to frailty, which includes attributes like height, weight, age, grip strength, and the presence or absence of frailty symptoms.

Similar to the "Student Performance Analysis" folder, the "Frailty Analysis" folder follows a structured organization:

data_raw: This directory contains the original, unprocessed data files related to frailty. data_clean: Here, you can access the data that has been cleaned and prepared for analysis. src: This folder contains Python scripts used for preprocessing and analyzing frailty data. results: Within this subfolder, you'll find the outcomes and results generated from the analysis of frailty data. To work with the provided code and perform data analysis, you'll need to have Jupyter and Python installed on your system.

In summary, this repository provides organized data and scripts for analyzing both student performance and frailty data using Python-based tools and software. The data is structured in raw and clean formats, and the results of the analysis are stored separately for easy access and reference.
